Practicals
==========

Code to accompany online tutorials and practicals produced by staff and members of the Multi Agent Systems and Simulation Research Group at the School of Geography, University of Leeds.

Please match the name of the practical to the folder.  Each named folder is the root for the project for that practical.  Unless otherwise stated the code in each of the practical folders is an example of how the final version of the code should look.

We hope you find the practicals and tutorials helpful.
